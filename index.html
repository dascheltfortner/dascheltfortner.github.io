          If your interest is piqued by the curiousities currently on display,
          consider inquiring further into the life of Daschel Fortner here.
          You will most likely discover nothing of real value, with a high 
          probability of disappointment. You will, however, most definitely 
          satisfy your own curiosity, and your fate appears much more 
          promising than the cat's.

          To inquire concerning my whereabouts in the past, and the present,
          enter here. There comes a time in a man's life when he must face 
          the fact that, though man cannot live by bread alone, he must eat 
          bread. It is a feature of reality that such wares require finances.
          Here, you can learn about the various avenues through which I have 
          attained said bread.

          As the late great Alexander Graham Bell remarked, "Come Dr. Watson,
          I need you," here you can follow in his steps by saying, "Come, Mr.
          Fortner, I need you." If your needs are quite as urgent as that, 
          however, perhaps you might consider contacting another individual
          closer to you than I. Nevertheless, the following link will provide
          you with a multitude of media through which you can inquire further
          of me.
