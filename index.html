            As the late great Alexander Graham Bell remarked, "Come Dr. Watson,
            I need you," here you can follow in his steps by saying, "Come, Mr.
            Fortner, I need you." If your needs are quite as urgent as that, 
            however, perhaps you might consider contacting another individual
            closer to you than I. Nevertheless, the following link will provide
            you with a multitude of media through which you can inquire further
            of me.
