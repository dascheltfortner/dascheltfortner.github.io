            If your interest is piqued by the curiousities currently on display,
            consider inquiring further into the life of Daschel Fortner by

            of real value, leaving you slightly disappointed. You will most 
            definitely satisfy your own curiosity, and your fate appears much 
            more promising than the cat's.

            To inquire concerning my whereabouts in the past, and the present,

            you care for that sort of thing, this section reveals my education.
            It also reveals my previous places of employment, as well as 
            current positions I hold.

            As the late great Alexander Graham Bell remarked, "Come Dr. Watson,
            I need you," here you can follow in his steps by saying, "Come, Mr.
            Fortner, I need you." If your needs are quite as urgent as that, 
            however, perhaps you might consider contacting another individual
            closer to you than I. Nevertheless, the following link will provide
            you with a multitude of media through which you can inquire further
            of me.
