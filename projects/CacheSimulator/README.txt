                        CACHE SIMULATOR PROJECT
                           By Daschel Fortner

I completed this project in HTML and Javascript. To run the program, unzip this
folder and place it where you want it. Then double-click on the index.html file
to run the web application in your default browser. 

During the application, you can enter in a memory address into the text box. 
Then, click the query button to query for that memory. It will notify you of a 
hit or a miss, and put the data in the cache. Use the radio buttons to select
FIFO or LRU replacement. To reset the app, just refresh the page.
