        <h3><em>FIT AS A FIDDLE!</em></h3>
        <p>
          About five years ago, I began learning the violin and took quite a 
          liking to it. After learning to sight read from books, I moved to 
          learning old-timey fiddle tunes from the internet. I began to frequent
          old-time jams and play in church, and I continue to play and enjoy 
          fiddle music to this very day. While I still play with friends, or 
          at an occasional chili dinner, I mostly practice for personal 
          enjoyment. It proves to be a wonderful reliever of stress.

            I am currently a sophomore student at Cedarville University, 
            pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I anticipate
            graduation in May of 2020.
