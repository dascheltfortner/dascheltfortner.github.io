How can it be that Paul was crucified with Christ? Well, I'm glad you asked.

All throughout the New Testament, Christians are seen as united to Jesus. One of
the most interesting ways this is described is like a marriage. When Christians
are converted, they are, in a sense, "married to Jesus". (Eph. 5:29-33)  

When two people get married, they leave their old lives behind. There is no 
reservation. Each person resigns themselves totally to the other. No other 
person will share in the intimate union that the couple shares. And there is
trust. The two make vows to each other, to give all to the other, trusting that
the other will surely make good on their promises. After the covenant is 
ratified, the two become one flesh. The two people who entered the wedding
cerimony leave as one. No longer independent, the two begin to tackle live as
a new unit.

Christians have this type of connection to Jesus. When people put their full
trust in Jesus, it is much like a marital connection. Neither the husband nor
the wife can be certain that the other will be faithful to their vow. Yet, they
put their full trust in the other, forsaking all else, to partake in the 
marriage. In this way, Christians, in a sense, become "one flesh" with Jesus. 



What is righteousness?
 -> acceptance
 -> recieving a good report

How can Christ be our righteousness?
  -> Christ doesn't confer righteousness
    -> Imputed righteousness doesn't mean that Jesus gives us righteousness
    -> Jesus alone is the righteous one
    -> Jesus was what everyone ought to have been
  -> Christ brings us into union with himself
    -> Weird
    -> Like a marriage
    -> "Put him on", "abide in him", all point to a mysterious union with Christ
      -> This refers to Christ and the church
      -> Wedding supper of the lamb
      -> Unbreakable commitment to those who trust in him
      -> Two become one flesh

What does this mean?
  -> Christ already died a death - the full payment of the law
    -> The penalty of breaking the law was death
    -> So, sinners who have broken the law, and merited death, have in a sense
        already died
        -> I am crucified with Christ
        -> other passages
    -> But God raised Jesus from the dead, vindicating him and seating him at his
        own right hand
        -> So, since we are united to him, we are raised with him
        -> passages

Implications
  -> I am and never will be righteous
  -> But through the union I have with Jesus, I have already paid the penalty
      of sin (dying with Jesus), and live vindicated in God's presence 
      (because Jesus is vindicated)
  -> Thus my righteousness and acceptance before God cannot be any worse than 
      his approval of Jesus

Shall I sin that grace may abound?
  -> But now you're free! Because what you are always looking for is fully 
      satisfied.
