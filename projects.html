        CACHE SIMULATOR
      </h2>

        I completed this project for a Computer Architecture class at Cedarville
        University. The application simulates a CPU with some main memory, as
        well as 2-way set associative cache. The application supports FIFO 
        replacement, as well as LRU replacement. To see what the program does, 
        just put a memory address in the text box and click the query button.

        DORM DESIGNER (FOR THE HILL)
      </h2>
      <p class="project-paragraph">
        It's hard to visualize what you want your dorm room to look like, so
        I created this app to lay out the items that come with your dorm at the
        Hill at Cedarville so I could come up with new layouts for that stuff.
